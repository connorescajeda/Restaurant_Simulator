# Restaurant Simulator

## What is it?
Restaurant Simulator is meant to be a hyper-realistic fast-food restaurant management game.

### What was used in the making?
I used a Python package called "pygame" which allows for many features that make creating games
a lot easier. It includes things such as event objects to create detectors for things like mouse clicks or scrolls.


### Interesting features
The tools I had at my disposal when I created this game weren't exactly the most user friendly for graphics or
user interaction so I had a lot of challenges with creating something as simple as a button. The buttons within this
game are completely created by me as their own object class. The other really difficult thing is that anytime anything on the screen needs to change I have to make sure that everything gets redrawn on the screen so nothing is static on the screen. Everything has to get dynamically put on each time you get a banana or the timer counts up. Yes, very inefficient but like I said these were the only tools at my disposal.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, I really enjoyed the time I had when I was making this. It is what made me fall in love with programming and computer science and is a huge reason I am on the path I am on. I hope one day to get the time to come back and create another incremental game and see just how far I have come from my first real project. I hope you enjoyed seeing my first real creation.


### Pictures of a games progression
* This is what the start of a game looks before you've started your banana empire.

* This is how the game looks after you started to gain some bananas and bought some banana buildings to increase your production.

* This is what happens when you buy the Banana Takeover building, and if you see it offers you the chance to restart in the middle.

* This is what happens when you have returned to a new universe, if you notice the buildings now all create more bananas than the last.
