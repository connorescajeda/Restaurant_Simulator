# Restaurant Simulator

## What is it?
Restaurant Simulator is meant to be a hyper-realistic fast-food restaurant management game. It allows for you to run a restaurant as a manager where you must keep up the stock of your inventory, micromanage your prices based on supply and demand, and see how long you successfully keep the business a float!

### What was used in the making?
The GUI was created using the JavaFX library combined with Scenebuilder to allow for an easily creatable GUI that has a lot of functionalities. Then the rest of the program is created using Java 11.


### Interesting features
This program while not having the most visually appealing GUI, it is jampacked with features beneath the hood. It has a "shop" where you are able to purchase all of the items that your restaurant sells and you can buy them in varying different amounts and the buy prices vary day by day so you have to always been checking in to see when you can get the best deals on items. You can also adjust all the prices of your items to however cheap or expensive you would like but be careful with that because with prices change, your customers might look for a new place to eat at or start buying the cheaper items. Along with this, the more money you make in a day the more people are going to be coming back the next day to get a meal from you. Then finally one last feature to really automate the system is auto-buy. After purchasing the feature for 1500$ in the game, you can set an amount of a respective item to buy and at what point it should get bought but you have to keep watch of your customer counts per day to make sure you are able to meet the demands of the ravenous customers.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, I spent a lot of time really trying to make the features of this game really complex and deep while being very simple to navigate and use. This project had lots and lots of hurdles and challenges in the creation but working through them and finding ways to solve them was absolutely one of the best feelings ever. I am really happy with how this application turned out and hope that as time goes on I can revisit something like this project and make huge improvements to it by maybe doing something with actual market data and creating a very nice GUI since this project was one of my first using a GUI.
